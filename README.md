OpenHabBachelor

This github repository contains two seperate projects:
NorthQStandalone, which is a standalone project for testing the RESTFul webservice of the NorthQ sensors, and org.openhab.bindings.northqbinding, that is a binding for the OpenHab project, for connecting the NorthQ sensors.
The binding project does only work in an already established OpenHab installation (http://docs.openhab.org/developers/development/ide.html).
